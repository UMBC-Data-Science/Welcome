# Welcome-Package
Here you can find data science tools that you should install and learn before you start the program.

## Github

If you haven't already please [create a Github account](https://github.com/join). You will be sharing your projects with your classmates and instructors via Github. For more information about how to use Github efficiently you can take a look at the following resources:

## Install Anaconda

In our program we will be using Python as the main programming language and one easy way to access to use Python is through Anaconda. You can go to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) directly to install Python by choosing your operating system or you can follow this tutorial on [how to install Anaconda on your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk&ab_channel=CoreySchafer).

## Python

As already mentioned above, we will mainly use Python in our courses and we assume that you know the basics of Python programming. If you need some a refresher please check the following resources:

[An easy to read book on Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/): We expect you to have some familiarity with the material in the first 12 chapters of this book.

[Python for everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons): A very popular introduction to Python course. You can omit lessons 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17 initially.
